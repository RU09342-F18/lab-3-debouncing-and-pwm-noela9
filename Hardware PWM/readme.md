The purpose of this lab was to test the Pulse Width Modulation output of the microcontroller. Each microcontroller has their own specific PWM output. With the 2553, the output is P1.6 and with the 2311, the output is P2.0. The timer is set to the Aclk internal clock to show the duty cycle of the PWM. As the button is pressed, the duty cycle should increase by 10 percent until it reaches 100%, then it should reset back to 0. That is all done using a port interrupt. The LED is toggled using a timer interrupt that also clears the clock.
