The function of the debouncing code is to give the hardware of the switch a smooth transistion. Usually when a switch is pressed, there is a period of time when the contacts of the switch go back and forth until it is at its next stage. The debouncer is used to remove the time where the switch is bouncing and allow the switch to be a high or a low. This was done by using a timer interrupt and a button interrupt. The button pin is set to be an input and an LED is set to be an output and the interrupt edge for the button port is set to be 1 and the edge is set to a falling edge. The timer is set to be ACLK and in up mode with an 8 divider. The timer interrupt removes the flag, sets an interrupt edge, and then clears the clock while the button interrupt toggles the LED, disables the interrupt and clears the flag. It also sets the control register of the timer to continuous mode.
